## Motivation
I wanted to build an app that shows off my JQuerry and DOM skills.

## Build Status
MVP. All of the game functions work. Only sized for larger screens.

- [ ] Fix tracking score, right now it seems to only be counting computer
- [ ] Fix issue with startBtn. Maybe issue with B
- [x] add note about ties in rules
- [ ] Make page responsive
- [ ] loop battle music


## Tech/framework used
* HTML 
* CSS 
* JavaSript 
* JQuerry

## Features

* Stats!

## How It Works

### Opening
This page informs the user there is sound, so they can adjust their speakers accordingly.

Any good game needs a good bad game. Pokemon fans will recognize Team Rocket and their classic theme music.

### Rules Screen
This screen shows the the user how to play the game.
